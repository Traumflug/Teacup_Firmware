  When hitting an endstop, Teacup properly decelerates instead of doing an

  the endstop trigger point by some distance.

  To deal with this, Teacup adapts homing movement speeds to what your
  endstops can deal with. The higher the allowed acceleration ( = deceleration,
  see #define ACCELERATION) and the more clearance the endstop comes with,
  the faster Teacup will do homing movements.

  Set here how many micrometers (mm * 1000) your endstop allows the carriage
  to overshoot the trigger point. Typically 1000 or 2000 for mechanical
  endstops, more for optical ones. You can set it to zero, in which case
  SEARCH_FEEDRATE_{XYZ} is used, but expect very slow homing movements.

  movement crossings, but is otherwise harmless. Too high values can result
