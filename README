Archiving hint: In late summer 2023, Github started to enforce 2FA (Two Factor
                Authentication), so I had to archive the repository before
                losing control over it.  See also https://github.com/Traumflug/Teacup_Firmware/issues/338

                At the point of archiving, Teacup Firmware happens to work
                just fine within the limits of ATmegas, Cortex-Ms and 32-bit
                integers.  Performance is as excellent as it can get.  Which
                is why development pretty much ceased a while ago already,
                simply because there was nothing left to fix or to improve.
                A masterpiece of low-level embedded software.
