		This algorithm causes the timer to fire when any axis needs to step, instead of synchronising to the axis with the most steps ala bresenham.

		This algorithm is not a type of acceleration, and I haven't worked out how to integrate acceleration with it.
		However it does control step timing, so acceleration algorithms seemed appropriate

		The Bresenham algorithm is great for drawing lines, but not so good for steppers - In the case where X steps 3 times to Y's two, Y experiences massive jitter as it steps in sync with X every 2 out of 3 X steps. This is a worst-case, but the problem exists for most non-45/90 degree moves. At higher speeds, the jitter /will/ cause position loss and unnecessary vibration.
		This algorithm instead calculates when a step occurs on any axis, and sets the timer to that value.

  When performing look-ahead, we need to decide what an acceptable jerk to the
  mechanics is. Look-ahead attempts to instantly change direction at movement
  crossings, which means instant changes in the speed of the axes participating
  in the movement. Define here how big the speed bumps on each of the axes is
  allowed to be.

  If you want a full stop before and after moving a specific axis, define
  MAX_JERK of this axis to 0. This is often wanted for the Z axis. If you want
  to ignore jerk on an axis, define it to twice the maximum feedrate of this
  axis.

  Having these values too low results in more than neccessary slowdown at
  movement crossings, but is otherwise harmless. Too high values can result
  in stepper motors suddenly stalling. If angles between movements in your
  G-code are small and your printer runs through entire curves full speed,
  there's no point in raising the values.
