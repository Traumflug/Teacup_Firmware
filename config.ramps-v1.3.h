		This algorithm causes the timer to fire when any axis needs to step, instead of synchronising to the axis with the most steps ala bresenham.

		This algorithm is not a type of acceleration, and I haven't worked out how to integrate acceleration with it.
		However it does control step timing, so acceleration algorithms seemed appropriate

		The Bresenham algorithm is great for drawing lines, but not so good for steppers - In the case where X steps 3 times to Y's two, Y experiences massive jitter as it steps in sync with X every 2 out of 3 X steps. This is a worst-case, but the problem exists for most non-45/90 degree moves. At higher speeds, the jitter /will/ cause position loss and unnecessary vibration.
		This algorithm instead calculates when a step occurs on any axis, and sets the timer to that value.
